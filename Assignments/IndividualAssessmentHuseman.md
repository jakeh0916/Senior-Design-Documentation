Our senior design project is an opportunity to put together knowledge obtained from the classroom, co-ops, and personal projects. Our project idea is still being developed, but we have nailed down several points we'd like to cover. For one, we would like to use AR/VR technology. This tech is used in a variety of "gimmicky" applications, and we believe it's best suited for visualization where traditional methods are lacking. For that reason, applications such as factory design and safety standards, interior design, or unique data visualization are where we find ourselves drawn. Over the next week we hope to come to a more refined project idea.

Throughout my time at UC, I've had the opportunity to do larger-scale projects in classes like Networks, Algorithms, AI, and Software Engineering, and each has presented a different challenge. Splitting up tasks, being responsible about planning and scale, understanding and researching technical ideas - these are all skills we have all honed over the past several years. None of these challenges, though, were "longevity." This is something that our senior design project will require. Throughout the next two semesters, we will have to (and have the opportunity to) stick with a long-term project.

I have spent my 5 co-op terms at Siemens DI SW. At first, I was on a team designing web applications for Siemens internal use. I did not enjoy working on web development, and so I requested to be switched to an NX team. NX is a 3D CAD software. I've spent the last 4 co-op terms on this team, and I've found a lot of enjoyment working on engineering-related content on a 3D application. I've developed skills working with 3D modeling and the programming behind rendering. This is one of the reasons I would like to work on a 3D project for senior design.

To elaborate on this, I'm motivated to work on this project due to an intrigue in 3D rendering and modeling and how this applies to real-world fields. The initial idea for this project I had was to create a "interior design" application in AR/VR, and we've taken this approach and morphed it into a more industry-related field. I find this "real world" aspect to be interesting and gives our work more purpose. 

I expect and hope that we will be able to create a simple but full-featured AR/VR application that meets the needs of a specific industry user. Additionally, I hope that our project will show expertise in 3D rendering and provide an optimized, enjoyable experience for the user. AR/VR is infamously "finicky" and can be difficult to get right. Since we are designing solutions to industry problems, we have set the bar high and I hope we can deliver a presentable, functioning application that aids industry professionals in their jobs.
