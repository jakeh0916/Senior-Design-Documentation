## Using Fishbowl as a Creator:

As a creator interested in making highly interactive and instructive virtual reality experiences, the first place that you will want to go is to the Creator menu when first opening the Fishbowl application. Here you can choose the initial scene that will serve as the starting point for your experience.

At this point, it would be most instructive to take the Creator Tutorial which is also located on the Creator menu. This tutorial will walk you through the general process of setting up a new experience, adding prompts for your users, adding new objects and zones or interaction and creating meaningful steps for your end users.

Taking the tutorial or not you will need to select a beginning scene. Upon making the selection you will start in this scene and be able to place initial objects which will remain the same throughout the entire experience. Think of these mainly as decoration. When you're ready go ahead and click the “Start Procedure” button.

In this stage of creation, you will be able to place something called zones, these zones establish areas where you would like your end users to do things like stand in or place objects. You can also interact with and create interactions between the objects you placed so that your users can follow these same actions.

You can separate all of these object placements and interactions into distinct steps so that your user will be able to more easily follow the flow of your experience. When your done recording placement or interactions, just click the “End Procedure/Step” button. When you have completed all of the required Procedures and Steps for your experience, you can save the experience to a playable format by pressing “End Recording”

## Using Fishbowl as a Player:
	
As a player who wants to play through interactive and instructional experiences made by other people, you will want to first go to the Play menu. Here you will be able to see all of the available experiences that other people have created or sent to you. If there is a specific experience that you want to play, try searching for it. When you have found the experience that you would like to play through, just go ahead and click on it.

After selecting the experience, you will find yourself in a scene with a varying number of objects around you. There may be an initial prompt left for you by the creator to provide some initial instruction. After this prompt, you may notice highlighted areas and other floating prompts throughout the scene. Approach these prompts or areas by physically moving or using your controllers.

Opening the in experience menu may provide you with the ability to place objects into the scene. You may interact with or use these objects to complete tasks as detailed in the prompts left by the experience creator. Other objects in areas of interest may highlight indicating that you need to move or interact with them to complete a series of steps. Remember to look around the scene for additional prompts or highlighted areas.

When all of the steps that the creator made has been accomplished, then the scene will display an ending prompt where you could optionally replay the experience or go back to the Play menu. Choosing to go back to the menu will allow you to select from or search for a new experience to complete.
