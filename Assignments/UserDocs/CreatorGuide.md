## Using Fishbowl as a Creator:

As a creator interested in making highly interactive and instructive virtual reality experiences, the first place that you will want to go is to the Creator menu when first opening the Fishbowl application. Here you can choose the initial scene that will serve as the starting point for your experience.

At this point, it would be most instructive to take the Creator Tutorial which is also located on the Creator menu. This tutorial will walk you through the general process of setting up a new experience, adding prompts for your users, adding new objects and zones or interaction and creating meaningful steps for your end users.

Taking the tutorial or not you will need to select a beginning scene. Upon making the selection you will start in this scene and be able to place initial objects which will remain the same throughout the entire experience. Think of these mainly as decoration. When you're ready go ahead and click the “Start Procedure” button.

In this stage of creation, you will be able to place something called zones, these zones establish areas where you would like your end users to do things like stand in or place objects. You can also interact with and create interactions between the objects you placed so that your users can follow these same actions.

You can separate all of these object placements and interactions into distinct steps so that your user will be able to more easily follow the flow of your experience. When your done recording placement or interactions, just click the “End Procedure/Step” button. When you have completed all of the required Procedures and Steps for your experience, you can save the experience to a playable format by pressing “End Recording”
