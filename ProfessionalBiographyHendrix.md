# Professional Biography

**Caleb Hendrix**
\
**University of Cincinnati, 5th Year Computer Science Major**

I decided to study computer science after taking a class on python programming and really enjoying it. Before that I was studying Neuroscience but didn't really see myself in that as a career. I have really enjoyed my CS courses and being able to work at companies like Siemens for my co-ops. Through working on 3D software at Siemens and hobbies like FPV drones I have become interested in VR and AR and spatial computing in general.

## Project Sought

I am interested in Argmented and Mixed Reality applications and those involving spatial computing. I really like working on 3D software and I think that there are many cool ideas coming out with AR and MR.

I would like to make an application for a MR headset device or a mobile device like a smartphone that allows users to experience AR and MR. I am not sure about the exact nature of the topic yet.
